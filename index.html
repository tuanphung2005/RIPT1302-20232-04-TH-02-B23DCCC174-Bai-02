        <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
        <p>A scatter plot shows the relationship between two continuous variables, x and y. The values for each variable correspond to positions on the x- and y-axis respectively. A dot or some other symbol is placed at the (x, y) coordinates for each pair of variables. The pattern of the dots can provide clues regarding how the two variables are related.</p>

        <h2>Line Chart</h2>
        <p>A line graph—also known as a line plot or a line chart—is a graph that uses lines to connect individual data points. A line graph displays quantitative values over a specified time interval. In finance, line graphs are commonly used to depict the historical price action of an asset or security. </p>

        <h2>Bar Chart</h2>
        <p>A bar chart (or graph) organises information into a graphic using bars of different lengths. The length of these bars is proportional to the size of the information they represent. </p>

    <section id="bubble-chart">
        <h2>Bubble Chart</h2>
        <p>Bubble charts were introduced by Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg as charts which represented items by labeled circles, whose areas are proportional to the displayed quantity. These charts effectively perform a visual square-root transformation and have since become a popular method of displaying data.</p>
